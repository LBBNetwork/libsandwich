Well hello there!

Getting assistant to run on your device is relatively easy, however, note that
dragons be ahead, so be wary, and don't do anything stupid.

This is not a step-for-step tutorial, you will need intelligence to carry this procedure
out, however, you won't need to be a l33t h4x0r to know what to do.

First, you will need to copy the resources from an iPhone 4S also known as the N94AP, such
as the dyld shared cache from /System/Library/Caches, and various framework resource files. 
(These are: AssistantServices, AssistantUI and SAObjects.framework). You will also need to
copy over the launch daemon property list files from the /System/Library/LaunchDaemons directory.

Second, you will need to modify the plist files to include the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES to include
/usr/lib/libsandwich.dylib (which we will compile later), and set DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE to 1,
 you need to modify com.apple.SpringBoard.plist, com.apple.assistantd.plist and the same for 
assistant_services.

Third, you will need to get the sessionValidationData member from a 4S using applidium's siri server
or any generic SSL MITM proxy, and then put a hex dump in com.vlo.libsandwich.plist 
(don't forget to define what's necessary!), then put all the necessary GUIDs in /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.assistant.plist. com.vlo.libsandwich.plist  goes in /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/ also. convertValidationData.rb may help :)

Compile libsandwich and place the dylib in /usr/lib!

Kill springboard and start the daemons, that should be it.

PS: Don't forget the GL driver, you may want it.

Thanks!
